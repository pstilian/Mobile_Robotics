Open up a program to preview the camera image (such as the CameraTest demo).
Open a separate terminal and enter the following commands.
Adjust the red_balance and blue_balance values as necessary until the image appears correct.

v4l2-ctl -c white_balance_auto_preset=0
v4l2-ctl -c red_balance=1400
v4l2-ctl -c blue_balance=1600
